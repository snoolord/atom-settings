This theme is intended for use with the [Material UI theme.](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui)\n\nMany other dark themes I tried had either over the top bright colours or excessively low contrast which wasn't too great on the eyes, so made my own. I'm learning front end development at the moment so there is a focus on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Javascript isn't finished yet and any further languages will be worked on further down the line, next is probably PHP.\n\nI have also made a [second version](https://github.com/SnowJambi/snow-dark-syntax) intended for use with the default One Dark UI theme.\n\n##Installation\n\nIn a console type\n\n```shell\napm install snow-dark-material-syntax\n```\nOr open the atom settings with ctrl+, and go to install, click themes and search for snow-dark-material-syntax.\n\n##Examples\n\n###HTML\n\n![snow-dark-material-html](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18164547/14588240/85161c0e-0507-11e6-8bc9-b4e12f9b37e6.png)\n\n###SCSS\n\n![snow-dark-material-scss](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18164547/14588241/866d5d9c-0507-11e6-9390-78fbe9a047d9.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/SnowJambi/snow-dark-material-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/SnowJambi/snow-dark-material-syntax#readme","_id":"snow-dark-material-syntax@0.1.1","_shasum":"7faa849ab090828b6188cc7f3d4bc0f774571d75","_resolved":"file:../d-1161029-84411-jbqg6w/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1161029-84411-jbqg6w/package.tgz"}
